    This bot is intended for the purpose of having fun with memes,

    You ended up spamming groups, getting reported left and right,
    and you ended up in a Finale Battle with Telegram and at the end
    Telegram Team deleted your account?
    And after that, then you pointed your fingers at us
    for getting your account deleted?
    I will be rolling on the floor laughing at you.
